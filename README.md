# Next.js 15 App Directory Bug: Unexpected Middleware Behavior with Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in Next.js 15's App directory when combining dynamic routes and middleware.  The middleware seemingly doesn't behave as expected when certain conditions are met, potentially leading to incorrect page rendering or access.

## Bug Description

When using dynamic routes in conjunction with middleware, the middleware might not correctly handle the dynamic route parameters, resulting in unexpected behavior.  This can manifest in several ways, such as the middleware always executing a default path regardless of the dynamic parameter values.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to different dynamic routes. Observe the inconsistent behavior of the middleware.

## Expected Behavior

The middleware should correctly handle the dynamic route parameters, allowing for different behavior based on the specific route.

## Actual Behavior

The middleware may not utilize the dynamic route parameters, instead resorting to a default behavior or failing to match.

## Solution

The proposed solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.  This solution often involves carefully reviewing and structuring the middleware logic, ensuring that dynamic parameters are correctly accessed and used in the middleware conditions.

This issue highlights a potential edge case or unexpected behavior within Next.js 15's App directory, especially with newer features.
